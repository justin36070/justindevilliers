        <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Justin de Villiers, a passionate university student at Stellenbosch University. I have a deep love for computers and a strong interest in the environment, which led me to pursue a degree in geoinformatics. From an early age, I discovered my knack for coding and have since nurtured and developed my talent over the years.</p>

    <p> Geoinformatics has been an exciting field for me as it combines my passion for computers with my desire to make a positive impact on the environment. By leveraging my skills in programming and data analysis, I strive to understand and manage geospatial data in innovative ways. Whether it's utilizing remote sensing techniques, performing spatial modeling, or creating visually captivating geospatial data visualizations, I'm driven to contribute to the sustainable management of our planet.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a deep appreciation for music and art. The creativity and expression found in these fields inspire me to think outside the box and bring a unique perspective to my work. I believe that the intersection of art and technology holds great potential for innovation and I'm excited to explore how these realms can intersect with geoinformatics.

    </p><p>As a university student, I constantly seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I'm actively engaged in courses, research projects, and extracurricular activities that further my understanding of geoinformatics, computer science, music, and art. Collaborating with professionals and fellow students in interdisciplinary projects fuels my curiosity and allows me to develop well-rounded expertise.

In the future, I envision a career where I can combine my passion for computers, the environment, music, and art. I aspire to make meaningful contributions that address pressing environmental challenges through the power of technology and data. I'm eager to embrace new challenges, continue learning, and collaborate with like-minded individuals who share my vision of a sustainable and harmonious future.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. I look forward to connecting and exploring exciting possibilities together!</p>
